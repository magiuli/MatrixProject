# MatrixProject

## Task requirements
In this project, we pooled together our accumulated knowledge to create a game using an 8x8 matrix alongside a menu displayed on an LCD screen. The assignment encompassed various requirements, including the creation of specific submenus, image display on the matrix, showcasing game statistics on the LCD screen, utilizing EEPROM to store system settings and high scores, integrating the buzzer, and many more.

## Backstory

For this project, I crafted a game inspired by Bomberman. It all began with homework 7, where the task was to create a small game on the LED matrix, drawing influence from Bomberman or Terminator Tank. Unbeknownst to me at the time, my choice was influenced by my familiarity with this type of game. During my childhood, I used to play a game called "Playing with Fire 2" (likely inspired by Bomberman) which can be found here: https://www.crazygames.com/game/playing-with-fire-2.

## Game description

In this simplified version of Bomberman, your mission is to destroy all the randomly generated walls using bombs. Although it appears straightforward, challenges await: the bombs can harm the player, who has only one life. Moreover, as time passes, bombs detonate quicker. Failure to move swiftly enough could lead to an explosive outcome right in your face.

## Instructions on how to play

Utilize the joystick to navigate in one of the four directions. Press the joystick to plant a bomb strategically. Ensure to evade the explosion by all means necessary.
